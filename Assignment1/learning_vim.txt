In this text file I will catalogue all the commands that I learn in Vim. I want to learn Vim because I heard it was very powerful and that Professor Salazar uses it.

The first thing I learned from him is how to open a file using... 
vim file_name

The next thing that I learned is how to quit out of a created file to go back to the command line instantly. This is a big plus of vim because it's accessed in the command line and therefore doesn't require multiple windows.
This is done by being out of insert mode and typing the following:
:wq

The next obvious thing that I needed to get comfortable with is going in and out of vim's insert mode. Pressing lowercase 'i' is god for entering insert mode and typing in thing like a regular text editor.

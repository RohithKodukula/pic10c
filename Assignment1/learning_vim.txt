# Learning how to code in vim
In this text file I will catalogue all the commands that I learn in Vim. I want to learn Vim because I heard it was very powerful and that Professor Salazar uses it.

# Opening and Closing
The first thing I learned from him is how to open a file using... 
vim file_name

The next thing that I learned is how to quit out of a created file to go back to the command line instantly. This is a big plus of vim because it's accessed in the command line and therefore doesn't require multiple windows.
This is done by being out of insert mode and typing the following:
:wq

# Insert Mode and Different Ways of Inserting
The next obvious thing that I needed to get comfortable with is going in and out of vim's insert mode. Pressing lowercase `'i'` is god for entering insert mode and typing in thing like a regular text editor. There is also a variation of getting insert mode be hitting lowercase `'o'` to open a line under the current.

# Navigating the Text
The next thing I learned was the use of ` 'h', 'j', 'k', and 'l' ` keys to move the cursor around instead of using the arrow keys as usual. It'll definitely take a while to get used to but it's nice to not have to move the fingers so much.

# Aesthetics: Line Numbers and Syntax Coloring
These types of commands that add line numbers and color your syntax according to the language of the document are custimizations that I saw other Vim tutorials often had. A quick research let me figure how to edit my own .vimrc file to make Vim open with the customizations each time.

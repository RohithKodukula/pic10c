# fridge_contents.txt
This file is written to keep track of a the contents of my refrigerator as people come and eat and get food. The quantity of each food is given in paranthesis next to the type of food. Each commit is either food being consumed for sustenance or food being added after someone perhaps gets groceries or as people bring food.

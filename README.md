# PIC 10C: Advanced Programming
This is a repository of work for Rohith Kodukula. His UID number at UCLA is 305109022 for reference. This ReadMe file contains descriptions of each folder and what is inside it.

## Assignment1
This assignment was assigned to get a working grip on how to use git commands to update a remote repository. The fridge_contents file was developed to keep a working history of what food is being kept inside the fridge. Food is consumed and removed from fridge while food is also brought to the fridge for groceries, potlucks, and what not.

## Assignment2
This assignment was given to get a good idea of how to layout different components in the Qt Layout Design Editor. The way that the editor was designed was quite self-explanatory. Since this was the first Qt project having I had great trouble trying to get the environment setup. I had a consistent error in the building of my programs: 
`cannot open file: 'qtmaind.lb'`
I emailed the TA about how I can get rid of this. We shall see what happens.
